# ✌️ conventional-changelog-emoji

[Conventional Commits](https://conventionalcommits.org/) is a community standard designed to generate software changes automatically.

We use emoji for our conventional commits to reduce technical jargon in our software.

Commits look like `✌️ My awesome change (#12)`. There’s emoji at the beginning, the description of the changes made in the middle and the number referencing the GitHub pull request at the end.

## 🧩 Install

```bash
npm install @atjson/conventional-changelog-emoji
```

### 🙋‍♀️ Do you have an emoji that you'd like to add?

Add your emoji to [this spreadsheet](https://github.com/CondeNast/conventional-changelog-emoji/tree/latest/src/emoji.csv) with the heading that it should live under, the severity of the change, and a 🚫 or ✅ indicating whether it should be included in the changelog.

The severity can be one of the following:

- `patch` indicates fixes and other changes
- `minor` indicates new features (and possibly fixes as well)
- `major` / `breaking` indicates that the software now works differently and will need to be updated accordingly

### 👉 Examples

Let’s use the commit examples used above:

- 📦 Release 0.2.8

- 🎉 Add horizontal rule and vertical adjustments for Google Docs paste ([#52](https://github.com/CondeNast/atjson/issues/52))
- ✨👑✨ Make Annotations classes instead of JS objects ([#54](<](https://github.com/CondeNast/atjson/issues/54)>))\
  \
   🚨 Schemas are now defined as a list of annotation classes, cf. `[Bold, Italic]`

And show what will be our changelog!
